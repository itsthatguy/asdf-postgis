## Dependencies
According to PostGIS installation page, you will need GEOS, Proj.4, GDAL, LibXML2 and JSON-C.
Finally, you will need a working installation of PostgreSQL. See [asdf-postgres](https://github.com/smashedtoatoms/asdf-postgres) for the asdf plugin.

    1. Hit the ok button and it will install.  If it already has it, then you are good.
  * Ubuntu
    1. ```sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential```
1. On Ubuntu, you will need libreadline
  1. ```sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev```

## ASDF options

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions on how to install & manage versions of Postgres.

When installing PostGIS using `asdf install`, you can pass custom configure options with the following env vars:

* `POSTGIS_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` - use only your configure options
* `POSTGIS_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` - append these configure options along with ones that this plugin already uses
